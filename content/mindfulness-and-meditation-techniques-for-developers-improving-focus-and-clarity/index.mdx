## India: The World’s Technology Engine
Among its many strengths, India has one that makes it one of the most promising countries in the world today. As the world searches for young talent and looks towards an increasingly integrated digital ecosystem- India is fast becoming the technology hub of the world.
What is Critical Information Infrastructure- the key fundamentals of any country’s digital ecosystem. CII includes any computer systems whose destruction would have debilitating effects on its national security, economy, public safety and public health.
Whether it is vast servers and databases storing the countries key national data, its banks with systems responsible for thousands of transactions everyday, power plants key to the country’s energy security, or its telecom networks which integrate systems and networks across the country- the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre(NCIIPC), a unit of NTRO, plays a key role as the national nodal body protecting all CII in the country. A part of its mandate is to undertake activities for developing and enabling the growth of skills working closely with academia et al for protection of CII.
While the Internet has made information available to all, it has also created dangers- in the form of cyber attackers—across the world in the form of espionage and cyber attacks.Whereas in Espionage- innocuous users- both individuals and organisations are unaware of the prying eyes of adversaries- who ultimately seek to steal valuable national data,On the other hand cyber attacks, can cause disruption, confusion and panic among the victims of attack, not to mention serious supply chain disruptions affecting the country.

## Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing
Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing aka VAPT plays a key role in monitoring the health of the Critical Information Infrastructure systems. This is the exercise that allows the tester to probe within the systems to understand the gaps that attackers could potentially exploit to breach the cybersecurity defence perimeter.
VAPT professionals need to search systems for vulnerabilities - looking deeply into the networks and devices across the entire architecture; find through detailed analysis potential vulnerabilities and once found, find ways to inform the infrastructure owners who then work towards finding ways to patch these vulnerabilities.
VAPT is a highly sought after skill that requires a combination of technical understanding, creativity and determination to persist. One should be able to wear the thinking hat of an attacker but with the intent to do good.

## Crowdsourcing of Ethical Hackers
With the above challenge in mind, NCIIPC in partnership with AICTE has decided to undertake a program for the crowdsourcing of ethical hackers from around the country.
These ethical hackers would need to have the technical skills, be willing to learn the global best practices, do deep research and study and last of all innovative with new ideas - it is with such a diverse and talented pool that such a program would succeed. Once vetted for credibility and skill, in coordination with CII management these ethical hackers would be given the opportunity to conduct VAPT exercises at CII entities
How does one set up such a pool- democratically and giving every one the opportunity to be part of it?
Well coming soon is the NCIIPC-AICTE Pentathon 2024
This will be India’s first national level VAPT exercise opening up the opportunity for all technical colleges and universities in India to participate in a challenge specially designed to resemble and mimic the real world CII entities.

## Students
Students can look forward to a gamified version of the VAPT challenges. They will be tested on a broad range of challenges of varying levels of design and difficulty. This will allow students of all range of abilities and experiences to participate and engage.
First timers, and those not well equipped with the appropriate skill sets would find it challenging and yet a very new experience –opening their minds and horizons to the possibilities in cyber space.
Veterans and those experienced in capture the flag domains would find similarity and ease of navigation, yet the challenges are designed to test the most well versed of the lot. So for everyone, this challenge will be one to look out for.

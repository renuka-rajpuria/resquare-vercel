## Overview
Hacking is building things that you always wanted to have but no one has built it yet. It's to come up with an amazing idea and work tirelessly on it. It is to fail, fail again and fail better. Try out new things and learn while doing that. It's to work together, collaborate and build things that are innovative. It is to be a better programmer. With that spirit, GE Healthcare is conducting a hackathon – 5G Hackathon 2024 and invites all the enthusiasts to participate in this interesting and engaging hackathon.

## Building a slice for HC equipment service over 5G

### Problem Statement: 

It is often the case that customers do not have enough network bandwidth for all data to be sent to the back office. In addition, the customer network is often unreliable to support remote troubleshooting and perform E-Delivery and installation of Load from Cold Software upgrades and/or patches/updates. 

There is therefore the need to create a shadow/private/hidden network of GEHC devices to the On Prem EDGE and to the back-office bypassing customer’s network infrastructure or resort to/fall back when the customer has a slow internet connection. This private network will enable real time data streaming to the back office and remote monitoring of devices and resources (Real Time Data transfer – Predictive Analytics). It will also provide faster and more reliable data transfer between GEHC devices (Redundancy). Finally, it will enable the use of shared service features and technologies (e.g., Tools, SW downloads) between GEHC devices 

### Expectations from the overall solution: 

Architecture, Device Configuration, 5G Hardware on the Device, 5G Routers/Gateway to the Backoffice. 

Technology to explore: 5G network edge (AWS Wavelength) – Prove out compute and storage at the edge. EHL at 5G edge. Service mesh network within hospital with 5G where cellular network is not available.  Amazon firestick 5G enabled connected to healthcare device – data collected in device transferred through 5G enabled dongle. – Gateway/booster for last mile reach. 

### Issues: 
How to enable hospitals to sniff into shadow/private network for data privacy compliance. Last mile – hospital 5G……but then GEHC private 5G network

## Enhanced patient care through seamless monitoring and data continuity

### Problem Statement: 

Whether a patient is being transferred from home to the hospital or moved between different hospital branches via an ambulance, the utilization current ecosystem for care continuum across care pathways and seamless data connectivity becomes crucial. Remote monitoring of the patient's vital signs becomes essential in this scenario. The implementation of continuous remote monitoring facilitated by technologies like 5G, or comparable alternatives could significantly enhance caregivers' ability to deliver improved patient care. 

### Expectations from the overall solution: 

A demonstration or proof of concept (POC) showcasing the viability of continuous monitoring across care pathways and seamless data connectivity to the IOMT ecosystem.

## 5G in Remote Radiotherapy delivery
### Problem Statement: 

Radiotherapy is one of the key elements in cancer care, which involves delivery of ionizing radiation beams to the tumor to kill it. One of the major hurdles to establishing more radiotherapy treatment units across the country is trained staff- in addition to a radiation oncologist, who treats the patient, radiation physicists and technicians are required, who plan out the treatment and ensure that is properly carried out. With newer techniques especially, quality assurance and control are vital- plans that are off by a margin of 2 mm (about 0.08 in) or so can result in treatment failure. Although in-house audits do happen, there is no central QA/QC for radiotherapy that happens outside of random selected cases in a clinical trial. This can result in significant variation in treatment quality and outcomes even within the same hospital. Building a platform for radiotherapy QA/QC using 5G would be a monumental task, but also have huge potential for radiotherapy delivery in the country. It would need to be able to handle transfer a large amount of data back and forth periodically (during the initial simulation, planning images, periodic re-imaging and plan audit data), the ability to edit live planning data remotely, archive this data in an organized fashion for subsequent data analytics, research and audit, and eventually when the system is built allow for AI/ML applications like automated planning, which are already under investigation in parts of the world. 

### Expectations from the overall solution: 

To oversee quality of radiotherapy delivery in areas where manpower and expertise is limited

## Continuous Monitoring of Ambulatory Patients using 5G
### Problem Statement: 

When a patient moves from a high acuity environment, like OR or ICU to a lower acuity ward, the possibility of an early discharge can be considered based on the patient's condition. This option is contingent upon the enablement of remote connectivity of the Portrait Hub from patient’s home with the portrait ecosystem, this integration empowers caregivers to provide patient care on need basis through remote monitoring. This approach accomplishes the following: 

Ensures that low acuity ward admissions in hospitals are prioritized for the most critical patients. 
Streamlines early patient discharge, leading to potential cost savings. 
If the reliability and latency of 5G meet the demands of real-time monitoring, the exploration of transitioning the current ecosystem from on-premises to a Cloud-based deployment becomes a viable next step. 
### Expectations from the overall solution: 

A demonstration or proof of concept (POC) showcasing the viability of continuous monitoring as patients are on movement, enabled by advanced technologies such as 5G

## About

Bhashini, the National Language Technology Mission (NLTM), was launched by the Prime Minister in July 2022 to provide language technology solutions as digital public goods through the Bhashini platform (https://bhashini.gov.in). This is aimed to be achieved by harnessing the emerging technologies such as AI/ML, NLP to develop and share open-source models, tools, and solutions (products and services) for Indian languages with ecosystem development involving startups, industries, academia, research groups, enthusiasts and State/Central Governments. The approach is to create large datasets in the Scheduled Indian Languages to train AI models for translation and conversion of speech to text and vice versa, including voice to voice translation for general usage as well as for specific domains/contexts like education, healthcare, and financial services etc.

1000+ pre-trained AI models have been made available on Bhashini platform. These AI language models have also been exposed via Open Bhashini APIs for Bhashini ecosystem partners. The next steps include large applications of public relevance along with fine tune AI models, demonstrate capability and acquire implementation experience, so that implementation approaches may be developed for common language technology requirements like intelligent voice-based user interfaces, document translation and website translation at scale.

An Independent Business Division (IBD), Digital India Bhashini Division (DIBD) has been set up under Digital India Corporation (DIC) to anchor the Mission Bhashini activities and to nurture the language technology ecosystem especially involving startups.

## Problem Statements

The proposed BHASHINI-SPRINT with Five (05) pre-identified problem statements tries to tackle challenges relating to various areas and segments related to Bhashini Technology and services.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 1 
BHASHINI NEGOTIATION ENGINE : DEVELOP A TECH FUNCTIONALITY TO BRIDGE THE LANGUAGE GAP IN A VOICE BASED NEGOTIATION SCENARIO
Description: A buyer (Language A) and seller (Language B) wants to finalize a deal after a negotiation. However, language barriers hinder smooth communication and potentially lead to misunderstandings and missed opportunities. Existing translation tools often lack the context and nuance required for complex negotiations also missing out on intent and sentiment. Current solutions may not capture regional dialects or cultural subtleties, potentially causing misinterpretations. Develop a functionality which can accurately translates not only words but also intent, sentiment, and cultural nuances between the seller and buyer facilitating a smoother negotiation and deal finalization.

Desired Outcome:

1. The tool can act as a seamless translator, understanding and conveying the full context of the conversation between both the parties, regardless of language

2. The tool accurately translates not only words but also intent, sentiment, and cultural nuances.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 2
DEVELOP A CHAT-BOT FACILITATING MULTILINGUAL CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR THE SELLER AND BUYER
Description: Existing translation tools might struggle with technical jargon or customer emotions. Develop a chatbot to facilitate the process among the existing eco-system for an efficient execution. The chatbot should be able to translate text-to-text, voice-to-voice, voicetext-voice

Desired Outcome:

1. The chatbot should provide real-time translation during customer service interactions, ensuring accurate and natural communication.

2. The tool can identify and translate customer emotions and respond empathetically

3. The tool can identify and translate customer emotions and respond empathetically

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 3
DEVELOP A SOFTWARE FACILITATING MULTILINGUAL NEW BUSINESS ONBOARDING ON AN E-COMMERCE PLATFORM
Description: : Currently, many small businesses struggle to list their products and services on emarketplaces due to language barriers. Existing translation tools often lead to inconsistent or inaccurate listings, hindering visibility and potential customer reach. Devise a solution which can ease out the process for the individual business owner during the onboarding process

Desired Outcome:

1. Facilitate the creation of accurate and comprehensive multilingual onboarding for businesses, ensuring consistency across languages.

2. Integrate with various e-marketplace platforms to simplify the onboarding process for businesses lacking language expertise

3. Offer translation services tailored to specific e-commerce needs, considering product descriptions, keywords, and marketing content.

4. Offer translation services tailored to specific e-commerce needs, considering product descriptions, keywords, and marketing content.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 4
STREAMLINED INVENTORY MANAGEMENT WITH VOICE COMMANDS AND ADVANCED IMAGE DETECTION FOR SELLERS
Description: : Manually managing inventory is time-consuming and error-prone, especially for small businesses with limited resources and limitation in reading and typing knowledge. Existing solutions often require manual data entry, hindering efficiency and accuracy. Propose a solution which can overcome this limitation. The tool can be integrated in the E-com platforms

Desired Outcome:

1. Perform real-time inventory checks and updates using voice commands in their preferred language, eliminating the need for manual data entry.

2. Perform real-time inventory checks and updates using voice commands in their preferred language, eliminating the need for manual data entry.

3. Receive voice-based alerts and notifications when stock levels reach predefined thresholds, facilitating proactive inventory management.

4. Offer customizable voice commands to streamline specific inventory management tasks, improving efficiency and reducing workload.

5. Image based inventory updation; The system utilizes advanced object detection algorithms to accurately count the number of items in the captured image. The system seamlessly integrates with existing inventory management software, automatically updating stock levels based on the object count.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 5
EMPOWERING VOICE-ACTIVATED SHOPPING IN AR/VR FOR MULTILINGUAL USERS
Description: : The growing popularity of AR/VR technology offers a new paradigm for online shopping, providing immersive and interactive experiences. However, current solutions often lack accessibility for users who are not fluent in the platform's primary language. Develop a functionality to bridge this gap by developing a voice-activated shopping system within an AR/VR environment, specifically catering to users with diverse language needs.

Desired Outcome:

Language barrier: Many potential AR/VR shoppers may not be comfortable using interfaces primarily in English or other dominant languages. The functionality should overcome this limitation

Limited voice interaction: Existing systems might not offer comprehensive voice command functionalities for searching, purchasing, and payment within AR/VR environments. This should be integrated

Inventory management across vendors: Integrating and searching inventory from multiple vendors can be complex, hindering product discovery and purchase completion. The functionality should address this as well.

The teams can choose to participate in one or all challenges.

## Stages

The BHASHINI-SPRINT is open for participation in teams having experts from all domains of a software development life cycle. It would be in three (3) stages:

### Stage 1
Teams will have to propose the innovative and cutting-edge ideas of their solution along with a prototype as per problem statement identified. The top 5 teams per problem statement would be selected from this stage.

### Stage 2
The shortlisted teams from stage 1 will be given a chance to develop a prototype based on the problem statements mentioned in Annexure A. In this stage top 3 teams selected from previous stage per problem statement will be given INR 50 each as grant to develop an enhanced version of the prototype.

### Stage 3
Shortlisted teams from stage 2 will present the enhanced version and final product to the committee in grand finale, 1 team per problem statement will be selected in this stage as a winner and 1 team will be selected as runner up and a grant of total INR 7 lakhs (5 lakh for winning team+ 2 Lakh for the runners up) will be given to them.

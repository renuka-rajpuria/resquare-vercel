## MANDATORY SURVEY & PRIVATE FEEDBACK FROM CONTEST MASTERS
FOR YOUR SUBMISSION TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE PRIZES, YOU MUST FILL THIS SURVEY by Apr 15, 2024 at 12:00 PM PT which will be worth 20% of your final grade and determine whether you are selected to win the hardware SUPERBOX: https://mtecethz.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bIZ8mGUQ2rjBS1o
In this survey for each focus area, you will explain the problem you identified and its underlying causes, as well as your proposed solution for that specific problem. üí°
We strongly suggest you to think carefully about the answers to those questions before filling out the survey to ensure your answers are as detailed as possible. ‚úèÔ∏è
Contest Masters will provide TAILORED FEEDBACK based on those answers to help you develop innovative solutions. üìù

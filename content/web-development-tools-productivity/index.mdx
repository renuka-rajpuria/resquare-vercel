## About

Official Website: https://bhashatechathon.com/

Digital India Bhashini Division, the National Language Technology Mission (NLTM), was inaugurated by the Prime Minister in July 2022 with the aim of providing language technology solutions as digital public goods through the Bhashini platform. This initiative is geared towards leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as AI/ML and NLP to develop and disseminate open-source models, tools, and solutions (products and services) for Indian languages. It encourages ecosystem development involving startups, industries, academia, research groups, enthusiasts, and both State and Central Governments.

The overarching objective is to compile extensive datasets in Scheduled Indian Languages to train AI models for tasks like translation, speech-to-text conversion, and vice versa, including voice-to-voice translation. These capabilities are intended for general use as well as for specific domains/contexts such as education, healthcare, and financial services.
